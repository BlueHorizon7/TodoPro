# Contributing to TodoPro

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you get started.

## Development

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2. Install dependencies and set up `.env` (see docs)
3. Run `npm run dev` and verify changes locally
4. Write tests if applicable and ensure `npm run build` passes

## Commit Style

- Use clear, imperative commit messages
- Reference issues when relevant (e.g., Fixes #123)

## Pull Requests

- Describe changes and rationale
- Include screenshots or recordings for UI changes
- Keep PRs focused and reasonably small
- Ensure lint/build passes

## Code Style

- Follow TypeScript strictness and avoid `any`
- Prefer explicit names and early returns
- Keep components small and composable; extract hooks/helpers when needed

## Reporting Issues

- Use the bug report template
- Include steps to reproduce, expected/actual behavior, screenshots

Thank you for helping improve TodoPro!
